    <h3>Hey, Blake Womack here. Welcome to my portfolio page. </br>I'll be working on this off and on throughout the next six months. </br>I like my work to be beautiful and tidy, <span id="jls"><strong>just like Switzerland.</strong></span>

    <h1>About Me.</h1>
    <p>I just spent five years working at Intel as a contingent worker helping them publish their public facing website. Prior to that I obtained a Digital Design certificate from PSU. I had been working in the Standby/Stationary Power Industry but left that to pursue a career that more closely aligns with my art degree. I have a BFA in Printmaking from the University of North Texas.

    <p>I was born in Dallas, TX but left soon after I graduated from college. I have lived all over the country and each place I have lived still has a little chunk of me blowing around on its streets.
