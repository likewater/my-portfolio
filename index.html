        <p class="bg-success">Hey, Blake Womack here. Welcome to my portfolio page. </br>I'll be working on this page off and on throughout the next six months adding to it and trying to make sure it reflects my best work. </br>I like my work to be beautiful and tidy, <span id="jls"><strong>just like Switzerland.</strong></span></br> So if you've ever been there you know what I'm talking about.</br> Remember, it was a Swiss typeface designer that invented Helvetica.

        <h1>About Me.</h1>
        <p>I just spent the last five years working at Intel as a contingent worker helping them publish their public facing website. Prior to that I earned a Digital Design certificate from PSU. I had been working in the Standby/Stationary Power Industry but left that to pursue a career that more closely aligns with my art degree.
        <p>I was born in Dallas, TX but soon after graduation from college I left. I have lived all over the country and each place I have lived still has a little chunk of me blowing around on its streets.
